# <strong>Company Insolvency Exploratory Data Analysis and prediction using Machine Learning</strong>

This notebook aims to analyse the financials of 6819 companies, and the solvency status of these companies to determine and predict the insolvency risk of such companies.
<br>
The data of the companies are taken from the UCI Machine Learning Repository
Repository: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Taiwanese+Bankruptcy+Prediction

# <strong>Approach</strong>
Exploratory data analysis is first used to understand the nature of the data; data distributions and correlations between the data and insilvency risk.<br>
The results of the analysis is then used to design and tune a Machine Learning Model suitable for predicting the insolvency risk of a company

# <strong>Conclusion</strong>
